# KrakenRelay - Open Source Repeater Controller

**KrakenRelay** is an open-source repeater controller application built with Python and PyQt5. It allows users to manage radio repeaters with advanced audio processing, squelch control, CTCSS tone detection, Morse code ID transmission, and more.

This project is inspired by [**SvxLink**](https://github.com/sm0svx/svxlink) (by **SM0SVX**) and provides a simplified, user-friendly interface for basic repeater or crossband operations. While SvxLink excels with advanced features like EchoLink, this project focuses on offering a more streamlined solution, removing unnecessary options for these specific applications. It‚Äôs designed to avoid the need for command-line configuration, making setup easier and more accessible. This project is not intended to replace SvxLink but rather to provide an alternative for users seeking a simpler, more focused implementation.

## Features

- üì° **Repeater Controller:** Routes audio from one radio on the input frequency and plays it back in real-time through the output frequency radio.
- üîä **CTCSS Tone Detection:** Detect and filter CTCSS tones‚Äîthis is how the PTT is controlled in the software. It does not start replaying through the output until the correct PL is detected.
- üéôÔ∏è **Morse Code ID & Courtesy Tone:** Automatically transmits CW ID at set intervals and includes a preconfigured courtesy tone.
- üéõÔ∏è **Noise Reduction:** Includes a high pass filter, noise gate and "squelch" to filter our interference and digital artifacts.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Graphical Interface:** PyQt5-based UI for easy configuration and monitoring.
- üîÑ **Cross-Platform:** Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Building a Standalone Executable

You can package the application into a standalone executable using PyInstaller:

```sh
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed KrakenRelay.spec
```

For Windows, this will create `dist/KrakenRelay.exe`.

For macOS/Linux, an equivalent binary will be generated in the `dist/` folder.

## Usage Guide

### General Instructions

1. **Connect Two Radios to the Soundcard**  
   - Use audio cables to connect any two radios that support such connections.

2. **Input Frequency Radio Setup**  
   - Connect the radio on the input frequency so that its audio output goes to an audio input on the computer.  
   - If possible, completely disable the transmit functionality on this radio.

3. **Output Frequency Radio Setup**  
   - Connect the radio on the output frequency so that the PC‚Äôs audio output goes to a mic input on the radio.  
   - Set this radio to VOX mode.  
   - Use a fairly sensitive VOX setting‚Äîthis setting may vary by radio, so you'll need to test and adjust for your specific setup.

4. **Optimize Audio Levels**  
   - Adjust audio levels in your system‚Äôs mixer and on the input frequency radio to achieve optimal audio quality.  
   - While the console will log alerts for distortion, fine-tuning by ear is still required for the best results.

### UV-5R Specific Instructions

1. **VOX Setting on the UV-5R**  
   - A recommended starting point for the UV-5R is a VOX value of 2. (Remember, this might vary, so further adjustment may be needed.)

2. **Disabling RX on the UV-5R**  
   - If possible, cut off the receive functionality on the output radio.  
   - On the UV-5R, this can be achieved using CHIRP by setting all squelch values to 123.  
   - This step prevents accidental transmissions and interference that could potentially jam the repeater.

### Software Setup

1. **Set Input and Output Devices** in the UI. Selecting "Default" will use the currently active devices, which is the easiest and most reliable method.
2. **Adjust Noise Reduction Settings** (Squelch, High-pass filter, Noise Gate).
3. **Configure Repeater Settings:**
   - Enter your callsign for the CW IDer if you wish to enable CW ID.
   - Choose the appropriate PL tone for your repeater system.
   - Ensure repeater users configure their radios with the correct transmit PL tone.
   - Matching RX and TX CTCSS tones on both radios helps keep unwanted transmissions out.
4. **Click "Start" to begin operating the repeater.**

The settings autosave after entry.
